## About

A robotics engineer and [systems builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_engineering) with deep experience across embodied AI, computer vision, and distributed architecture.

A [polymath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polymath) who bridges the gap between rigorous academic research and shipping scalable, production-grade products.

## Experience

### Techolution
**AI Engineer**
[https://www.techolution.com/](https://www.techolution.com/)

Leading AI development for Embodied AI initiatives, integrating advanced computer vision with real-time inference backends.

Developed an end-to-end AI pipeline for a robotic arm achieving **97% task accuracy** and **2mm precision**, bridging the gap between perception and actuation.

Engineered the "AI-Hand Bartender" system and a video-based learning mechanism for extracting 6D pose data, enabling robots to learn complex manipulation tasks from demonstration.

Explored Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in NVIDIA Isaac Sim and built real-time camera calibration pipelines to ensure robust performance in dynamic physical environments.

### AI Institute of South Carolina (AIISC)
**AI Researcher**
[https://aiisc.ai/](https://aiisc.ai/)

Conducting research at the intersection of computer vision, AI detectability, and watermarking techniques (Project PECCAVI).

Co-authoring papers under Dr. Amitava Das to enhance AI system robustness and forensic integrity, focusing on the traceability of synthetic media.

Serving as Associate Organizer for the Defactify 4.0 workshop at AAAI 2025, contributing to the global dialogue on AI fact-checking and misinformation.

### Dassault Systèmes
**Deep Learning Researcher**
[https://www.3ds.com/](https://www.3ds.com/)

Developed a novel Stutter Detection system using Wav2Vec2 and Agnostic BERT architectures.

Trained and fine-tuned models on diverse Indian language datasets, achieving a **WER of 0.31**, significantly improving accessibility tools for speech-impaired users.

## In Between These Experiences

### The Builder's Arc

I don't just write code; I build systems. My journey has been defined by a shift from simple tools to complex, agentic architectures.

It started with **EchoSense**, a real-time assistance platform for the visually impaired. It wasn't just an app; it was my first patent.

Then came **HingFlow**, where I tackled the complexity of code-switching in NLP, building models that could understand the chaotic mix of Hindi and English used by millions.

Most recently, I've been obsessed with **Agentic Systems**. At Techolution, I'm not just scripting robots; I'm giving them autonomy. I'm building systems where the "personal data" isn't just a log file, but the primary interface for an intelligent agent that executes tasks, not just suggests them.

**Hard work and consistency pay off. Each project was a step forward, from simple scripts to autonomous agents.**

## Research Publications

### Cross-Compatible Encryption Adapter for Securing Legacy Modbus Devices
**2025 17th International Conference on COMmunication Systems and NETworks (COMSNETS)**
Authors: Shreyas Dixit; T. S. Sreeram
[https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS63942.2025.10885597](https://doi.org/10.1109/COMSNETS63942.2025.10885597)

**Abstract:**
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems manage critical infrastructure but are often vulnerable due to legacy protocols like Modbus. We proposed a hardware adapter that introduces modern encryption to these legacy loops without requiring expensive system overhauls. The solution is cost-efficient, cross-platform, and designed for easy retrofitting in industrial environments.

### Peccavi: Visual Paraphrase Attack Safe Image Watermarking
**arXiv Preprint**
Authors: S Dixit, A Aziz, S Bajpai, V Sharma, A Chadha, V Jain, A Das
[https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22960](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22960)

**Abstract:**
A novel watermarking technique ensuring traceability of synthetic media against paraphrase attacks, enhancing the forensic integrity of GenAI content.

## Tech Stack

I'm a generalist at heart who can build with anything, but here's the core stack I've spent the most time with:

**Core:** Python, C++, Go, TypeScript
**AI/ML:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Hugging Face, OpenCV, YOLO, NVIDIA Isaac Sim
**Web & Cloud:** Next.js, React, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, Google Cloud
**Systems:** Linux, ROS2, Modbus, gRPC

## Writings & Blogs

I host my thoughts on [Medium](https://medium.com/@srddev) rather than building a custom site. Instead of overengineering, I prefer leveraging a mature platform to share insights on AI systems, product strategy, and technical architecture.

## Life Outside Work

When I step away from the screen, I trade neural networks for race strategies. I’m a massive F1 enthusiast and a die-hard Manchester United supporter, always drawn to the high stakes, precision, and passion of competitive sports.

I also love unwinding with the sharp wit of *Suits* (Harvey Specter is a personal favorite). But above all, I value real connections—spending quality time with friends, whether we're debating the latest match or just hanging out, is where I find my true balance and recharge.
